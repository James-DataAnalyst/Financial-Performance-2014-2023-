## Introduction
In today’s fast-paced business environment, financial transparency and data-driven decision-making are crucial for success. Organizations need a clear picture of their revenue trends, profitability, liquidity, and overall financial health to make informed strategic choices. However, many companies struggle with scattered financial data, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights.

This project aims to solve that challenge by building interactive financial dashboards in Excel that provide a comprehensive view of an organization’s financial standing. The dashboards utilize dynamic visualizations to track revenue, net income, profitability margins, liquidity ratios, and other key financial indicators. With these insights, businesses can optimize financial performance, improve cash flow management, and boost investor confidence.

## About the dataset 
The dataset consists of financial data spanning fro 10 years (2014-2023), including key metrics such as:
- Total Revenue and Net Income
- Profitability Ratios (Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets, Return on Equity)
- Liquidity Ratios (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Cash Ratio)
- Debt and Equity Analysis
- Employee Distribution and Financial Summary

The data was cleaned, structured, and visualized to unlock hidden patterns and improve financial transparency.
